Binary Search has a worst case time complexity of O (log(n)) which is much better than the worst case complexity of Linear Search (which has a time complexity of O (n)).

Binary Search is more suitable than Linear Search as the products array/list will contain a large number of items as the platform scale and thus on the basis of time complexity, binary search can be opted.

However, If the products array/list contain less number of products, then Linear Search may be opted.
